# php-iGenetic
This class can be used to optimize order of sequences with Genetic algorithm.  It can take an array with a sequence of objects to optimize and it applies genetic algorithm to evolve the sequence.  The class applies a given number of generations to perform elitistic selection with a given fitness function, applies cross-over and mutation.  The resulting sequence of objects is stored as an array class variable.  An example is provided to optimize a sequence of cities to travel.
